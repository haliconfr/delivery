animal crossing unity remake/fangame

features:

- dialogue system with scrolling text
- 3d modelled animal crossing-esque characters
- cafe and casino areas with characters to talk to and minigames to play
- easy to customise main character and side characters
- models saved in .blend form
- smooth camera transitions
- plane flying
- already set up to use my unity-autoinstaller if you want

music was composed by Scruffy and Rud
uses a world rolling shader to mimic the one used in Animal Crossing, which was made by NotSlot.

3d models and code are free to use, music is free to use as long as it isn't monitized.
anything made by me doesn't need credit :)
